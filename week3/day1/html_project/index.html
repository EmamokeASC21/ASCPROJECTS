    <h1>MY FAVORITE RAPPER: POLO G</h1>
       <h1>Where it all Started</h1>

       <h1>Polo G's real name is Taurus Tremani Bartlett and he was born Born in 1999 and raised in the rough  neighborhood of northern Chicago, Polo G was rapping by the time he was a teenager. His earliest songs appeared in 2017, but it wasn't until his breakout single "Finer Things" that the rapper began to really take off. The motivational song was written when Polo was incarcerated, and once he was free, he recorded it and made a video to go with it, which immediately caught the attention of millions.</h1>

          <h1> POLO G'S BEST ALBUM IN MY OPINION</h1>

          <h1> In my opinion I think that Polo G's best album has to be "The Goat" which in my opnion has no misses whatsoever. Even though his antagonists say that he uses relatively the same piano beat in his music, if you really takw a listen to the lyrics of his song it elevates him to a whole other level.</h1>
